What I was most proud of in this assignment:

	loginScreen was very flexible. E.g backspacing from password to username / pressing DELETE key to delete all.
	
	loading screen was more difficult than I anticipated to create. I am proud because I finished it.
	
	3d sphere implementation. I think the screen looked pretty cool and futuristic and I learned about P3D.
		Also, I practiced vectors in the creation
		
	While I couldn't fix a problem with displaying text in the rectangular buttons, The main menu
		was well animated in my opinion. It made me happy to see my perseverance infront of me.
		
	Class Loading used inheritance. I learned about inheritance and benefitted from its convenience.
