OOP assignment 1 

C15446648 Daniel Moloney

What I was most proud of in this assignment:

	loginScreen was very flexible. E.g backspacing from password to username / pressing DELETE key to delete all.
	
	loading screen was more difficult than I anticipated to create. I am proud because I finished it.
	
	3d sphere implementation. I think the screen looked pretty cool and futuristic and I learned about P3D.
		Also, I practiced vectors in the creation
		
	While I couldn't fix a problem with displaying text in the rectangular buttons, The main menu
		was well animated in my opinion. It made me happy to see my perseverance infront of me.
		
	Class Loading used inheritance. I learned about inheritance and benefitted from its convenience.
	
	
	What I learned: 
	
		inheritance
		using P3D
		how to create dynamically changing text boxes
		file manipulation techniques
		vector usage
		image file manipulation
		transparency usage
		improved my skill in arrayList manipulation
		furthered my understanding of classes
		
		
	What I feel I need to improve on most
		
		I need to work on my code design. While a lot of my code was functioning and complicated, I feel as if 
		I did not do my effort any justice in the more clunky design at stages.
		
		I learned from doing this assignment that I must improve my code design skills.
		
		I must make sure to use proper sound files next time for a more immersive experience.
		
	
	Overall, the assignment was a great learning experience! I know now what shortcomings I can improve
	for the christmas assignment. I will strive to make my next assignment more advanced using 
	the knowledge i gained. 
	
	:D
